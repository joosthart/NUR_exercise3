## Usage
All code is run from the `run.sh` script. Running the code is as easy as
    
    ./run.sh

This command will generate a pdf-file, `solutions.pdf`, which contains a report of the answers to the problems in `Hand-in_2_NUR2020.pdf`. All plots and code outputs are saved in `./plots` and `./outputs`, respectively.
